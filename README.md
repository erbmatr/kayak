# **🧭 Kayak — Smart Trip Recommender**
A data-driven prototype to inspire your next getaway.

### **Overview**
This project explores how real-time data can enhance the travel experience by identifying the best places to visit in France, based on a combination of weather conditions and hotel quality.

Designed as a proof of concept for Kayak, the travel search platform, it aims to go beyond price comparisons — helping users decide where to go, and when.

### **Why this project?**
Trip planning is exciting… but also overwhelming. Most people hesitate because they lack trusted, relevant, and personalized information.

To address this, I created a system that combines live weather forecasts and hotel reviews to dynamically highlight the most attractive destinations — in real time.

Whether you're chasing sunshine or charming cities, the goal is to answer one simple question:

Where should I go next weekend, and which hotel should I book?

### **How it works**
This smart recommender is built on a robust data pipeline that combines multiple components:

🔸 Weather data
→ Retrieved using OpenWeatherMap with geographic coordinates from Nominatim

🔸 Hotel data
→ Scraped directly from Booking.com, including names, locations, ratings, and descriptions

🔸 Data pipeline
→ Raw data stored in AWS S3, then processed and structured in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS

🔸 Visualization
→ Interactive maps created with Plotly for intuitive and dynamic exploration

### **Smart Recommendations**
The application analyzes and ranks destinations using real-time weather metrics such as:

Rainfall probability

Temperature

Humidity

It then pairs those insights with top-rated hotels in each location, making it easy to identify the most appealing destinations — and where to stay once you're there.

🗺️ Focus Area: France 🇫🇷
The system was applied to a curated list of 35 iconic French cities, including: Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Colmar, Annecy, Biarritz, Eguisheim, Bormes-les-Mimosas, and many more.

This scope allowed for a diverse range of styles and regions — from cultural capitals to coastal escapes — while ensuring high data quality and personalization.

### **Preview**
Two interactive maps were designed as part of the project:

- 🏆 Top 5 destinations to travel in the next 7 days
- 🏨 Top 20 hotels across all destinations

These visualizations help users explore travel options intuitively and make decisions based on current conditions.
